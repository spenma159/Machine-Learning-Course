        "Dating back to the dawn of the 19th century,\n",
        "linear regression flows from a few simple assumptions.\n",
        "First, we assume that the relationship between\n",

        "i.e., that $y$ can be expressed as a weighted sum\n",

        "(following a Gaussian distribution).\n",

        "To motivate the approach, let us start with a running example.\n",
        "Suppose that we wish to estimate the prices of houses (in dollars)\n",
        "based on their area (in square feet) and age (in years).\n",
